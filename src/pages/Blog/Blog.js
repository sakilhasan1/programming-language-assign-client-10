            <p className='text-success'>A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.[1] Most programming languages are text-based formal languages, but they may also be graphical. They are a kind of computer language.

                The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language. Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.

                Programming language theory is a subfield of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.

                Tips for Programming Beginners
                Coding and programming demand is skyrocketing every single day. Programming and software creation is now a billion-dollar business. Apart from the list of the best programming blogs and websites, you saw above, here are a few top tips that will help you in mastering your coding skills!
                Start with the Basics: It’s crucial for you to learn the basics first in any programming language. It will get much simpler to learn the programming language once you understand the fundamentals correctly.

                Code by Hand: If you ever want to study programming languages to a fundamental degree, the only successful way to go is to write codes by hand.
                Learn by Practicing: You’ll find a lot of free online programs, videos, guides, etc. to learn how to code, but you’ll only be able to code once you really start doing it. You can use free programming sites to educate yourself and even use their educational software to start coding.
                Look for as Many Courses as You Can: One platform will teach you something, and other platforms will teach you a few other coding talents, so when you start out, make sure you spend your time searching for as many courses as you can.
